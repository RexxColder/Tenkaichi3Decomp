# Audio

Sources: `src/sys/adx.c` (streamed audio), `src/sys/snd.c` (sound effects), `src/sys/file.c`
(player creation). Layouts: `include/sys/adx.h`, `include/sys/snd.h`.

There are two independent paths: streamed audio through CRI ADX, and sample-based sound effects
through the game's own I/O-processor driver `SOUNDS.IRX`.

## Streamed audio: ADX (verified)

Six ADXT players (2 channels each, server frequency 30), created at startup:

| Player | Label | Wrappers | Default volume |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `BGM` | `Bgm_*` | 0x40 |
| 1 | `MAP` | `MapBgm_*` (prefix is a guess: a second music stream) | 0x40 |
| 2, 3 | `SE ` | `StreamSe_*` (prefix is a guess) | 0x40 |
| 4, 5 | `VIC` | `Voice_*` | 0x80 |

- Volume: game range 0..0x80. Linear value `vol * gain[player] * save volume / 0x480`, clamped to
  0..0x80, with gains `{0x3C, 0x58, 0x60, 0x80, 0x46, 0x46}` (0x80 = unity). Players 0-1 use the
  save's music volume, the rest the sound-effect volume (both 0..9).
- Output level: 0 maps to -960 (mute); otherwise `sin((0x80 - v) / 128)^2 * 0.28 * -960`. That
  the unit is 0.1 dB is inferred.
- Pan: -0x40..0x40, converted as `(pan - 1) / 4`.
- `Adx_Play` sets pan and volume, unpauses, then starts the file by id. On players 4 and 5 it
  returns without playing when `func_00259E20(voice, 0)` or `(voice, 1)` is non-zero (a per-side
  mute; what sets it is unknown).
- `*_PlayPaused` starts paused and `*_Resume` releases; `Adx_FadeOutStep` lowers the level by 120
  per call down to -960; `Adx_StopAll` stops all six and pumps the CRI main loop until every
  status is 0.
- Character voice lines: file id `chara * 100 + line + 0x8D4E`, or `+ 0xCC32` when bit 0 of the
  save flags is set (see save_data.md).

## Sound effects: SOUNDS.IRX (game side verified; what the driver does is inferred)

### Model

- Eight bank slots, named by mask `1 << slot`. A sound id is the sample index inside its bank,
  0..255.
- Bank file: five words `{?, bodyOfs, hdOfs, seqOfs, endOfs}` then three sections: ADPCM sample
  body (uploaded to sound RAM), a Sony HD header and a third section of unknown content (both
  copied to I/O-processor memory).
- Mask 1 is the common bank (file 0x14B, loaded at boot). Masks 4, 8, 0x10 and 0x20 are loaded
  for a battle; 0x10 and 0x20 are the two sides' voice banks and are replaced in place when a
  character changes.
- One bank uploads at a time; a bank still pending refuses to play.

### Per-frame command queue

Play and stop never talk to the driver directly. They append a 12-byte `SndCmd` to a 32-entry
queue; a 33rd is dropped and the play returns -1. `Snd_Update` sends the queue once per frame,
so a sound starts on the following frame.

`SndCmd`: `u8 type` (0 play, 1 stop by bank+id, 2 stop by handle), `u8 loop`, `u16 handle`,
`u8 bank mask`, `u8 id`, `u8 volume`, `u8 pan`, `s32 pitch` in cents. The handle is a counter
generated on the game side and is what `Snd_PlaySeEx` returns.

`Snd_PlaySeEx(mask, id, volume, pan, pitch)`:
- volume: `volume * bankVolume[slot] * save seVolume / 0x480`, clamped 0..0x7F; bank volumes
  `{0xD8, 0xE0, 0x80, 0x80, 0x80, 0x80, 0x80, 0}`
- pan: `pan + 0x40`, clamped 0..0x7F
- pitch: `pitch * 18.75` cents, clamped to +-1200 (64 units per octave)
- returns -1 when the bank is not loaded or pending, when the mask is 0x10 or 0x20 and the
  per-side mute is set, when the queue is full, or when an argument is out of range.

`Snd_PlaySe(mask, id)` is `Snd_PlaySeEx(mask, id, 0x40, 0, 0)`.

### RPC protocol

One SIF RPC client bound to server id 0x2000004. Every call blocks. Send buffer 0x188 bytes.

| fno | Size | Payload | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0x0 | 4 | | init |
| 0x1 | 4 | | term (never called) |
| 0x2 | 4 | | reset / stop all |
| 0x3 | 0x10 | mask, spuAddr, hdIopAddr, seqIopAddr | bank data is in place |
| 0x4 | 4 | mask | bank freed |
| 0x5 | 4 | 0 stereo / 1 mono | |
| 0x6 | 8 | mask, on | pause / resume (battle pause sends 4,1 and 4,0) |
| 0x7 | 8 | mask, volume | only sent as (0xFF, 0x7F) at init |
| 0x9 | 4 | | per-frame tick, sent before the queue |
| 0xA | 4 | mask | stop the voices of those banks |
| 0xD | 0x184 | `SndQueue` | the per-frame commands |
| 0xF | 0x18 | count, ids | both sides' fighter ids, every battle frame |
| 0x8, 0xB, 0xC, 0xE | | | never sent |

Sample upload does not go through SOUNDS.IRX: it uses Sony's libsdr remote calls directly.

### For a port

The sound-effect layer is a thin command protocol, so it can be replaced by a mixer that
consumes the same queued commands. Not yet known: the HD header format, the third bank section,
and why the driver is sent the fighter ids every frame.
