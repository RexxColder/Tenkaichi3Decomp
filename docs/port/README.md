# PC port: working notes

This repository is the PC port. It was cloned from the matching decompilation at tag
`port-base-2026-10-05`; the decompilation stays a separate repository and is the remote
`decomp` here. `git fetch decomp && git merge decomp/master` brings in later matching work.

## Rules of the layout

- `src/`, `include/`, `config/`, `scripts/`: the decompilation's files. Do not edit them here.
  When a game source needs a change to build on PC, make it in the decompilation behind
  `#ifdef PORT`, check there that the matching build is still byte-identical, then merge.
- `port/`: everything that exists only for the PC build (compatibility header, platform
  layer, tools, build files). `port/build/` is output and is ignored.
- `port/include/port_compat.h` is forced into every game source (`-include`). It defines
  `PORT`, takes over the base types (`long` is 64-bit on the PS2, so `s64 / u64` become
  `long long`) and turns the assembly-inclusion macros into nothing.

## State on 2026-10-05 (first day)

Verified by running the tools below:
- All 204 game sources of the main executable and all 69 menu-overlay sources pass the host
  compiler's front end as 32-bit code (`port/tools/survey.py`). Three `#ifdef PORT` guards
  were needed: the 128-bit typedefs (include/sys/dma.h), one 128-bit store (Dma_BeginDirect),
  and five cast macros that are assigned to.
- 196 of 204 compile to objects (`port/tools/undefined.py`). The eight that do not contain
  MIPS inline assembly: dma.c, file.c, mathf.c, randf.c, vu0_a_c.c, vu0_a_c_b.c, vu0_a_c_c.c,
  vu0_b_c.c (the vector library has exact C references in src/port/).
- What a link of those 196 objects still needs (list in port/build/undefined.txt):
  423 data symbols (data the decompilation still keeps in assembly chunks: to be extracted
  from the original executable by a tool, the user's own copy, not committed), 179 game
  functions (the INCLUDE_ASM functions whose C sits in `#if 0`, the hand-written assembly
  routines, and the functions of the eight files above), 69 library functions (Sony SDK,
  CRI sound, libc: the platform layer), 12 others (menu-overlay entry points and host
  compiler helpers).

## Decisions so far

- 32-bit host build first (`-m32`): the game stores pointers in 32-bit fields everywhere.
  A 64-bit build (needed for Android) is a later clean-up, not a blocker for validation.
- First milestone (docs/roadmap.md stage 2): the fight simulation headless, fed by a replay
  recorded on the original, compared frame by frame.

## State at the end of 2026-10-05

Tools (run from the repository root, in this order): `port/tools/gen_data.py` (the game's
remaining assembly data as host assembly, from the decompilation's generated asm/),
then `port/tools/undefined.py` (compiles everything to port/build/obj and lists what a link
still needs in port/build/undefined.txt). `port/tools/portsrc.py` is their shared module: it
lists the sources of the PC build and switches on the C of functions that the matching build
still takes from assembly.

Verified by running them: 202 of 204 game sources of the main executable build to 32-bit
objects (the four vu0 files are replaced by src/port/vu0_a.c + vu0_b.c compiled under the
game's names through port/src/vu0_names.h). Still failing: mathf.c and randf.c (COP1 / VU0
assembly: need PC versions on the PS2 float model, including the VU0 random register).
A link still needs: 21 data symbols (VU1 microprograms and a few tables), 39 game functions
(mathf, randf, three StgVu_Rotate routines, ObjSeam_TransformVtx, the entry point, and
library names in the game range), about 190 library functions (Sony SDK, CRI, libc; many are
referenced only by library data tables that the PC build can drop).

NOT verified: that every vector-library reference has the same parameter list as the game's
callers expect (the callers declare these functions locally); the maths harness will show it.

## Update 2026-10-05 (late): every game source builds

All 204 game sources of the main executable build to 32-bit objects. mathf.c / randf.c: their
five assembly functions (Mathf_WrapAngle, Mathf_SinFast, Mathf_Sqrt, Rand_SeedFloat,
Rand_Float01) are guarded by `#ifndef PORT` and supplied by port/src/mathf_pc.c, operation
by operation on the PS2 float model; the VU0 random register is `gPortVu0R` (simulation
state: it must be saved and restored with the rest for netplay). Sanity-checked only
(sine within 0.002 of libm, square roots, value range of the generator), not against a console.
Game routines still missing: StgVu_RotateX / Y / Z, ObjSeam_TransformVtx (hand-written VU0
assembly outside the vector library) and the entry point.

Open points for bit-exact simulation, none solved yet:
- The game's ordinary C float arithmetic is compiled natively here (IEEE, round to nearest);
  the PS2 truncates and has no denormals / infinities. Decide: software float for simulation
  code, or prove where it matters.
- libm (sinf, tanf, asinf, acosf, atanf, atan2f) and libc rand() are the SDK's newlib
  versions on the PS2; the host's give different bits. The PC build needs its own exact copies.

## Next steps, in order

1. DONE: data (gen_data.py). 2. DONE except mathf.c / randf.c. 3. DONE (portsrc.py).
4. Platform layer for the 69 library functions: files from loose folders, memory, pad,
   stubs for sound and the GS for the headless build.
5. Link, boot to the battle loop, replay validation.
