# Shared brief: the menu overlay DBZP.BIN (tenth batch)

Read docs/agent_rules.md and docs/decomp_guide.md first (all of the guide, including the
"Matching lessons" sections at the end), then docs/game_overview.md (what it says about
DBZP.BIN and the progress-mode dispatcher), docs/systems/menu_support.md,
docs/systems/save_data.md, docs/systems/graphics.md (dialog, text printer, movie data) and
docs/systems/boot_and_frame.md.

The overlay: disc/BIN/DBZP.BIN, loaded at 0x00334C00, code 0x334C00..0x3B0E04 (737 functions),
data from 0x3B0E80 (file offset 0x7C280). It shares the main executable's `$gp` (0x304270) and
is compiled with ee-gcc 2.96 -O2 **-G0** (no gp-relative access at all, not even to the main
executable's small globals); scripts/fdiff.py uses -G0 for anything under src/menu/. It is the whole front end: a dispatcher
on `gProgress->mode` (values 1..70, jump table at 0x3B1130) whose handlers each run one screen
(title, menus, character / stage select, options, shop, story, tournament, replay menu, ...)
and call the main executable for everything shared: `Dialog_*`, `McFlow_*`, `GetWin_*`,
`MsgWin_*`, `IconWin_*`, `ChrView_*`, `TextBox_*`, `ChrGrid_*`, `StgGrid_*`, `Num_*`,
`FlashAnim_*`, the Flash-like movie player, `Font_*`, `Snd_*`, pads, files.

Disassembly snapshot to read from (NOT the live asm/ folder):
/tmp/claude-1000/-home-z3-Desktop-decomp-bt3/ed9e766e-dea6-4684-86f5-14b7166075c4/scratchpad/snap3/asm/dbzp/000000.s
(one file; data in .../snap3/asm/dbzp/data/07C280.data.s). Main-executable names: look
addresses up in config/symbols/*.txt (`grep -rn "0x0025CFC0" config/`); the snapshot predates
most of them, so a `func_XXXXXXXX` there usually has a real name now, and the linked source in
src/ says what it does. Read the callee's source before guessing at a call's meaning.

Rules of the road: as in docs/briefs_remaining_main.md (new files only; no edits to existing
files; no ninja / configure / git; fdiff to verify; compare emitted .rodata / .lit4 / .sdata
bits with the original; check call targets by address; whole range in address order;
INCLUDE_ASM with a behaviourally exact attempt in `#if 0` for what resists; every function
named, guesses marked; split files at module boundaries and say where and why).
Files go in src/menu/<stem>.c, include/menu/<stem>.h, config/symbols/<stem>.txt.

Report as agent_rules.md asks, plus: which `gProgress->mode` values your screens are and how
each screen flows (states, what it loads, which mode it sets next); the data structures and
tables; file ids loaded and asset formats parsed; what is read from / written to `gSaveData`
and `gProgress`; how the battle is set up from the menu (anything written to the battle setup
is the hand-off to the simulation: document it exactly); random draws and their generator;
pad reads; original bugs; object-boundary evidence for the integrator.

## What the pilot (chunk 1) established: read before starting

- Verify with `python3 scripts/fdiff.py src/menu/<file>.c` (it reads every config/symbols/*.txt
  and routes addresses >= 0x334C00 to disc/BIN/DBZP.BIN). Before reporting also run a copy of
  build/scratch_menu_a/linkcheck.py edited for your files: it applies every relocation and
  compares all bytes including .rodata, which checks what fdiff masks (call targets, data
  addresses, strings, tables).
- Read src/menu/menu_a*.c and include/menu/menu_a.h first: the header has the local views
  (`MFlash`, `MFlashRef`, `MFlashUv` (0x14 bytes), `MTexRes`, `MenuProgress`, `MTextBox`) and
  the main-executable prototypes; include it. docs/systems/menu_overlay.md has the mode table
  (which handler runs which `gProgress->mode`), the archive pointers and the screen pattern.
- The overlay's data is laid out PER OBJECT as `.data` then `.rodata`; a block of initialised
  data in the middle of the string area marks the start of a new object. This compiler shares
  identical strings within one file, so a string that exists twice means two source files.
  Say where your objects' data starts and ends.
- A screen follows one pattern: a heap work struct behind a global pointer, `X_Init` (load a
  section of an archive, `Sprite_Unpack`, `Res_RelocateOffsets`, `Flash_Create`), `X_Update` /
  `X_Input` / `X_Draw`, `X_Term`, and `X_Run` with its own frame loop.
- Matching lessons: (1) a screen's movies are an array of one walked with a loop:
  `for (i = 0; i < 1; i++) Flash_Destroy(&gX->flash[i]);` (symptom otherwise: `lui / addiu /
  lw 0(s0)` where the original has `lui / lw %lo(sym)(s0)`); `Flash_Create` / `Flash_Play` in
  Init are plain `&gX->flash[0]`. (2) Write globals plainly. (3) `while (1)` and `for (;;)`
  give different loop layouts; try both. (4) `flags & (s32)(1U << i)` gives `sllv / and`.
  (5) Float literals are truncated: write the rounded-up decimal and compare bits. (6) An
  extra `beqzl n / break 7` with no `div` is a second evaluation of the same `% n` expression
  (a macro). (7) `addu` operand order on an indexed save access: use a local pointer
  (`SaveSlot *slot = &gSaveData->slot[n];`). (8) Store order of the four uv words matters.
- Chunk boundaries are function-boundary cuts, not object boundaries: chunk 2 starts in the
  middle of the `ModeMenu` object (src/menu/menu_a_d.c is its head). Expect the same at your
  edges and say what you find.
