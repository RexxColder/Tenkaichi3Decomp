/*
 * Controller-removed watcher. Source range 0x267B90-0x268248.
 *
 * Every frame (PadWatch_Update, from Gfx_EndFrame) the connection state of both controller ports
 * is sampled (Pad.status != PAD_STATUS_NONE) and debounced: a reading has to stay the same for
 * 7 consecutive frames before it replaces the accepted state. From the accepted states and the
 * number of controllers the current screen needs, `message` is chosen:
 *   -1  nothing to report        0  controller 1 missing
 *    1  controller 2 missing     2  both missing
 * Two controllers are needed in a split-screen battle (unless func_00212A08() is non-zero), or
 * outside a battle when gProgress->mode is 0x27 / 0x28 and gProgress + 0x620 is 1; otherwise only
 * port 1 is looked at.
 *
 * PadWatch_Draw (also from Gfx_EndFrame, after everything else) darkens the whole screen with a
 * black sprite of alpha 0x60 and prints text `message` of the boot file's table at +0x24, centred.
 * Nothing is drawn while disabled (PadWatch_SetEnabled(0), used around loading screens) or in a
 * battle of mode 7.
 *
 * PadWatch_GetMissing is what makes this more than a display: the battle's pause poll
 * (func_0022F9F8) calls it, and when it returns 1 the battle is paused.
