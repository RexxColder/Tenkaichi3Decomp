/*
 * Memory of the PC build.
 *
 * The game was written for a machine with 32 MB at fixed addresses and it stores pointers in 32-bit fields, so the
 * 32-bit PC build gives it memory at PS2 addresses:
 *   0x00400000..0x02000000  the game heap. The game takes it with ONE malloc at start-up (Heap_Create,
 *                           0x1EFB000 minus the end of the menu overlay); Port_Malloc serves it from here, so
 *                           heap pointers have PS2-like values. The exact PS2 start address is not known yet
 *                           (needed only to compare raw pointers with an emulator dump).
 *   0x10000000, 0x12000000  hardware registers (timers, DMA, GS): plain memory here, so reads give what was last
 *                           written (0 at start: "transfer finished").
 *   0x70000000              the 16 KB scratchpad.
